<h1>Project Title: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Linear Regression Algorithm</h1>
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>diabetes
In this project, we have implemented the Linear Regression algorithm to measure the the cost of Medical Insurance based on a set of people profile data attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information about various features like age, sex, bmi, smoker etc. that can be used to predict the Cost of Insurance. The Linear Regression algorithm will allow us to identify that, What will be Medical Insurance Cost for Person.
